# OpenAI Compatible Assistant - API Testing Guide

This comprehensive testing guide provides curl commands for testing all endpoints of the deployed CloudFlare Worker. The API is designed to be compatible with OpenAI's Assistant API while running on Cloudflare Workers infrastructure.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. Deploy the CloudFlare Worker to get your `WORKER_URL`
2. Set your `API_KEY` secret in the worker configuration
3. Have `GEMINI_API_KEY` configured for AI functionality

```bash
# Example setup (replace with your actual values)
export WORKER_URL="https://your-worker.your-account.workers.dev"
export API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Base Testing Commands
```bash
# Test with authentication
curl -X GET "$WORKER_URL/health" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"

# Test without authentication (for health check)
curl -X GET "$WORKER_URL/health"
```

    "name": "<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>",
    "instructions": "Test instructions",
    "model": "gemini-pro"
  }'
```

### Test SQL Injection Prevention
```bash
curl -X GET "$WORKER_URL/v1/assistants/%27%20OR%20%271%27%3D%271" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
```

## üìù Best Practices for Testing

1. **Start with Health Checks**: Always test the health endpoint first
2. **Test Authentication**: Verify all endpoints require proper authentication
3. **Use Realistic Data**: Test with data that mirrors production usage
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Include empty strings, maximum lengths, special characters
5. **Monitor Rate Limits**: Be aware of rate limiting when load testing
6. **Check CORS**: Test cross-origin requests if needed
7. **Validate Responses**: Check both HTTP status codes and response content
8. **Test Error Scenarios**: Ensure proper error handling and user-friendly messages
9. **Monitor Logs**: Check CloudFlare dashboard for detailed logs
10. **Clean Up**: Delete test resources to avoid accumulation

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**401 Unauthorized**
- Check if API_KEY is correct
- Ensure Authorization header format is `Bearer {API_KEY}`

**404 Not Found**
- Verify WORKER_URL is correct
- Check endpoint path spelling

**429 Too Many Requests**
- Rate limit exceeded, wait before retrying
- Consider using rate limit bypass key if available

**500 Internal Server Error**
- Check worker logs in CloudFlare dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

**502/503 Errors**
- Worker may be temporarily unavailable
- Check CloudFlare status page

### Getting Help

1. Check the worker logs in CloudFlare dashboard
2. Verify environment variable configuration
3. Test with simple requests first (health check)
4. Check API key and authentication format
5. Review the wrangler.toml configuration
